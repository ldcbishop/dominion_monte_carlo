dominion_monte_carlo
The main idea of this project is to simulate simple Dominion markets and track salient statistics to predict interesting scenarios. This includes practicing different statistical measures
to classify results, different comparisons to visualize how simple player decisions affect the flow of the game.

As of now, the intention is to avoid player interaction. For now, this means no attack cards but might eventually. The first goal is to look at how a "Big Money" game plays against other more varied strategies.

A grand quote from user Jeff Wolfe regarding treasures:

There is the Intention and there is the Rule. The Intention is not the Rule. The Rule is the Rule.

The Intention came first. The Intention was that there be enough basic Treasure so that it doesn't run out. It turns out that the Intention is physically impossible in a game played with real cards. So they made the Rule. The Rule can be paraphrased as: Start with 60 Copper, 40 Silver, and 30 Gold; take out 7 Copper for each player's hand and whatever is left goes in the Supply. When a pile of Treasure runs out, it counts for end game conditions.

When Intrigue came out, they published the Intention. That may have been a mistake because it confused some people. They thought the Intention was the Rule. But it wasn't. It was the Intention. The Rule was still the Rule. Except they changed the Rule. They added the Option. The Option is that you can combine the Treasure from the base game and Intrigue if you want to do that. An empty Treasure pile still counts for end game conditions, regardless of how much Treasure you start with. So the Rule is still the Rule, but now it includes the Option.

Then there is the Philosophy. The Philosophy, which the designer has expressed many times, might be paraphrased as: do what you want. They're your cards and you can play however you please. The designer doesn't really care if you follow the Rule or not. So maybe you look at the Intention and you apply the Philosophy and you play some other way. That's fine. But that's not the Rule. The Rule, as it turns out, is still the Rule.

Someone might apply the Philosophy when they decide to break the Rule. But the Philosophy equally applies to someone who wants to follow the Rule. If you want to follow the Rule, that's fine. You might have a justification for following the Rule, such as running a tournament. You might not. You might just want to follow the Rule. And that's okay.

But before you can follow the Rule, you need to know what the Rule is. If someone asks me what the Rule is, say here in this thread, and if I choose to answer, I will explain the Rule to the best of my ability. And then they will know the Rule, or at least my interpretation of it. Because regardless of the Intention or the Philosophy, and with the addition of the Option, the Rule, I will assert again, is the Rule.
